# Challenge-Week-1


##Description

My motivation for this was to reorganize and clean code for a marketing agency.
Marketing agency asked to makde their code follow accessibility standards.
With this in mind, it solves the issue of the code not being accessible enough.
It also allows the code to be easy to read and follow the logic. 
While working on this, I was able to learn that I should always have the user in mind.
One future update that could be added would be to have text to speech.
